# Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that explains the behavior of very small particles, such as atoms and subatomic particles, which classical mechanics cannot accurately describe. While Newtonian mechanics works well for everyday objects, it breaks down when dealing with phenomena at the atomic or subatomic scale.

## Classical vs. Quantum Mechanics
- **Classical mechanics** (Newtonian mechanics): Describes the motion of visible, tangible objects, like a rolling ball or a moving car, based on predictable laws.
- **Quantum mechanics**: Governs the behavior of particles like electrons, protons, and photons, especially at high speeds or tiny scales.

## Understanding Matter
Take an example of a metal block:
- The block is made of atoms, and each atom consists of a nucleus (protons and neutrons) and electrons orbiting around it.
- Protons and neutrons are further composed of smaller particles, and their behavior is governed by quantum mechanics.

## Quantum Energy
A **quantum** is a single, indivisible packet of energy. For example:
- Light consists of photons, the smallest units of light energy, each carrying one quantum of energy.
- When a photon interacts with an electron in an atom, it can energize the electron to move to a higher energy level or orbit.

## Wave-Particle Duality
One of the fascinating properties in quantum mechanics is **wave-particle duality**:
- Particles like photons and electrons can behave both like waves and particles.
- For instance, if electrons pass through two slits, they form an interference pattern typical of waves. But when observed, they behave like particles, forming distinct points on a screen.

## The Role of Observation
Quantum particles behave differently depending on whether they are being observed:
- Without observation, particles like electrons or photons show wave-like properties.
- When observed (e.g., using a detector), they act like particles, highlighting how measurement affects their behavior.

Quantum mechanics challenges our intuition and forms the foundation for advanced technologies like quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.
