# Quantum Circuits

Quantum circuits are the framework for quantum computation. They consist of a sequence of quantum gates, which are applied to qubits to perform quantum operations.

## What is a Quantum Circuit?

A quantum circuit is a model for quantum computation in which a computation is a sequence of quantum gates, which are reversible transformations on a quantum mechanical analog of an n-bit register. The quantum circuit model is the most widely used model for quantum computation.

## Structure of Quantum Circuits

Quantum circuits are composed of qubits and quantum gates. The qubits are the basic units of quantum information, and the quantum gates are the operations that manipulate the qubits. A quantum circuit can be represented as a series of quantum gates applied to a set of qubits.

### Example of a Quantum Circuit

Consider a simple quantum circuit with two qubits and two quantum gates:

1. Apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit.
2. Apply a CNOT gate with the first qubit as the control and the second qubit as the target.

The resulting quantum circuit can be represented as:

```
|0⟩ --H--*--
          |
|0⟩ ------X--
```

In this example, the Hadamard gate creates a superposition state for the first qubit, and the CNOT gate entangles the two qubits.

## Role in Quantum Computing

Quantum circuits are essential for implementing quantum algorithms. They provide a visual and mathematical representation of the sequence of operations needed to perform a quantum computation. By designing and analyzing quantum circuits, researchers can develop new quantum algorithms and optimize existing ones.

In summary, quantum circuits are the framework for quantum computation, consisting of qubits and quantum gates. They provide a model for designing and implementing quantum algorithms.
