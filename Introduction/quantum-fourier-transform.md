# Quantum Fourier Transform

The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a quantum analog of the classical discrete Fourier transform (DFT). It is a linear transformation on quantum bits and is a crucial component in many quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers.

## What is the Quantum Fourier Transform?

The QFT is a unitary transformation that maps a quantum state to its Fourier coefficients. It operates on a quantum register of qubits and transforms the amplitudes of the quantum state into a new set of amplitudes that represent the Fourier coefficients.

## Mathematical Representation

The QFT can be mathematically represented as follows:

Given a quantum state |ψ⟩ = Σ_x a_x |x⟩, where a_x are the amplitudes and |x⟩ are the basis states, the QFT transforms this state into:

QFT(|ψ⟩) = Σ_y b_y |y⟩

where b_y are the new amplitudes given by:

b_y = (1/√N) Σ_x a_x e^(2πixy/N)

Here, N is the number of basis states, and e^(2πixy/N) is a complex exponential term.

## Quantum Circuit for QFT

The QFT can be implemented using a quantum circuit composed of Hadamard gates and controlled phase shift gates. The circuit for a 3-qubit QFT is shown below:

1. Apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit.
2. Apply a controlled phase shift gate with angle π/2 to the second qubit, controlled by the first qubit.
3. Apply a controlled phase shift gate with angle π/4 to the third qubit, controlled by the first qubit.
4. Apply a Hadamard gate to the second qubit.
5. Apply a controlled phase shift gate with angle π/2 to the third qubit, controlled by the second qubit.
6. Apply a Hadamard gate to the third qubit.

The resulting quantum circuit can be represented as:

```
|q0⟩ --H--*--------*--
          |        |
|q1⟩ -----|--H--*--|--
          |     |  |
|q2⟩ -----|-----|--H--
          |     |
          R(π/2) R(π/4)
```

## Applications of QFT

The QFT is a key component in several quantum algorithms, including:

- **Shor's Algorithm**: Used for factoring large numbers and finding discrete logarithms.
- **Quantum Phase Estimation**: Used for estimating the phase of an eigenvalue of a unitary operator.
- **Quantum Speedup**: Provides exponential speedup for certain problems compared to classical algorithms.

In summary, the Quantum Fourier Transform is a fundamental operation in quantum computing, enabling efficient implementation of various quantum algorithms.
