# Quantum Phase Estimation

Quantum phase estimation is a fundamental quantum algorithm used to estimate the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator. It is a crucial subroutine in many other quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm and algorithms for solving linear systems of equations.

## What is Quantum Phase Estimation?

Quantum phase estimation is a process that allows us to determine the phase θ in the eigenvalue equation U|ψ⟩ = e^(2πiθ)|ψ⟩, where U is a unitary operator, |ψ⟩ is an eigenvector of U, and e^(2πiθ) is the corresponding eigenvalue.

## Steps of Quantum Phase Estimation

The quantum phase estimation algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. **Prepare the initial state**: Initialize a quantum register with n qubits in the |0⟩ state and an additional qubit in the |ψ⟩ state.
2. **Apply Hadamard gates**: Apply Hadamard gates to the n qubits to create a superposition of all possible states.
3. **Apply controlled-U operations**: Apply controlled-U operations, where U is the unitary operator whose eigenvalue we want to estimate. The control qubits are the n qubits, and the target qubit is the |ψ⟩ state.
4. **Perform inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**: Apply the inverse QFT to the n qubits to transform the state into a form that allows us to measure the phase.
5. **Measure the qubits**: Measure the n qubits to obtain the binary representation of the phase θ.

## Quantum Circuit for Phase Estimation

The quantum circuit for phase estimation involves the following components:

1. **Hadamard gates**: Create a superposition of states.
2. **Controlled-U operations**: Apply the unitary operator U conditionally based on the control qubits.
3. **Inverse QFT**: Transform the state to allow phase measurement.
4. **Measurement**: Measure the qubits to obtain the phase.

The circuit can be represented as follows:

```
|0⟩ --H--*--------------------*--QFT†--M
         |                    |
|0⟩ --H--|--*-----------------*--QFT†--M
         |  |                |
|ψ⟩ -----U--U^2--U^4--...--U^2^(n-1)--M
```

## Applications of Quantum Phase Estimation

Quantum phase estimation is a key component in several quantum algorithms, including:

- **Shor's Algorithm**: Used for factoring large numbers and finding discrete logarithms.
- **Quantum Simulation**: Used for simulating quantum systems and estimating energy levels of molecules.
- **Quantum Speedup**: Provides exponential speedup for certain problems compared to classical algorithms.

In summary, quantum phase estimation is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing, enabling the estimation of eigenvalues of unitary operators and serving as a crucial subroutine in various quantum algorithms.
