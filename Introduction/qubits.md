# Qubits

In classical computing, the basic unit of information is the bit, which can be either 0 or 1. In quantum computing, the basic unit of information is the qubit (quantum bit).

## What is a Qubit?

A qubit is a two-level quantum system where the two basis states are usually denoted as |0⟩ and |1⟩. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can be in a superposition of both |0⟩ and |1⟩ states simultaneously. This property is what gives quantum computers their potential power.

## Superposition

Superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. A qubit can exist in a superposition of both |0⟩ and |1⟩ states, which means it can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time. Mathematically, a qubit in superposition is described by:

|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

where α and β are complex numbers that represent the probability amplitudes of the qubit being in state |0⟩ and |1⟩, respectively. The probabilities must satisfy the normalization condition:

|α|^2 + |β|^2 = 1

## Entanglement

Qubits can also be entangled, a phenomenon where the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of another qubit, no matter the distance between them. Entanglement is a key resource for many quantum algorithms and protocols.

## Measurement

When a qubit is measured, it collapses to one of the basis states, either |0⟩ or |1⟩, with probabilities |α|^2 and |β|^2, respectively. This collapse is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and is what makes quantum computing different from classical computing.

## Role in Quantum Computing

Qubits are the building blocks of quantum computers. They enable quantum computers to perform complex calculations more efficiently than classical computers for certain problems. The ability to be in superposition and entanglement allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information simultaneously.

In summary, qubits are the fundamental units of quantum information, and their unique properties of superposition and entanglement are what give quantum computers their potential power.
