# Classical Logic Gates in Computers

## Introduction
In classical computers (such as laptops, desktops, servers, and mobile phones), we use **classical logic gates** that work with **ones** and **zeros**. These gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. In this session, we will discuss how these classical logic gates work, their types, and the corresponding truth tables.

## Classical Logic Gates and Truth Tables
A **truth table** shows the relationship between inputs and outputs for a given logic gate. In classical circuits, the state of the circuit is defined by whether current flows or not. The flow of current represents the binary state of the circuit—either **1** (current flows) or **0** (no current).

### Example: OR Gate
- **OR Gate**: The output will be `1` if any of the inputs is `1`.
  
| A | B | Output (A OR B) |
|---|---|-----------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0               |
| 0 | 1 | 1               |
| 1 | 0 | 1               |
| 1 | 1 | 1               |

**OR Gate Circuit**:
- If either circuit A or B is closed, the output will be `1` (current flows).
- If both are open, the output will be `0` (no current).

### Other Classical Logic Gates
- **NOT Gate (Inverter)**: A single-input gate that outputs the opposite of the input.
  - If input is `0`, output is `1`.
  - If input is `1`, output is `0`.

- **AND Gate**: The output is `1` only if both inputs are `1` (similar to multiplication).
  
| A | B | Output (A AND B) |
|---|---|------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0                |
| 0 | 1 | 0                |
| 1 | 0 | 0                |
| 1 | 1 | 1                |

- **XOR Gate**: The output is `1` if exactly one input is `1`.
  
| A | B | Output (A XOR B) |
|---|---|------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0                |
| 0 | 1 | 1                |
| 1 | 0 | 1                |
| 1 | 1 | 0                |

- **NAND Gate**: The output is the opposite of the AND gate.

| A | B | Output (A NAND B) |
|---|---|-------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 1                 |
| 0 | 1 | 1                 |
| 1 | 0 | 1                 |
| 1 | 1 | 0                 |

- **NOR Gate**: The output is the opposite of the OR gate.

| A | B | Output (A NOR B) |
|---|---|------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 1                |
| 0 | 1 | 0                |
| 1 | 0 | 0                |
| 1 | 1 | 0                |

- **XNOR Gate**: The output is the opposite of the XOR gate.

| A | B | Output (A XNOR B) |
|---|---|-------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 1                 |
| 0 | 1 | 0                 |
| 1 | 0 | 0                 |
| 1 | 1 | 1                 |

## Combining Logic Gates
Logic gates are combined to form circuits that perform arithmetic operations such as **addition** and **multiplication**. These circuits can be designed using combinations of AND, OR, and other gates.

### Example: Calculation of **AB + AC**
To calculate **AB + AC** (dot product of A, B and A, C), we can use an arrangement of gates:
- Two AND gates are used to calculate **AB** and **AC**.
- An OR gate is used to combine the outputs of the AND gates.

### Another Example: Calculation of **A AND (B + C)**
In this case, we first calculate **B + C** (using an OR gate) and then use an AND gate to find the result of **A AND (B + C)**.
