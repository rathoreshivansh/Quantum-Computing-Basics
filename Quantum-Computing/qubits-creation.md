## Creation, Retention, and Readout of Qubits

In classical computers, we have many types of storage devices like hard disks and RAM that store bits using different physical properties:

- **Hard disks** use magnetic fields to represent binary data. If the magnetic field is present, it's "1"; if absent, it's "0."
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)** stores bits as electric charges. A bit is stored as "1" if it has a charge (e.g., 5 volts), and "0" if there is no charge.
- **Cache memory** on the motherboard holds frequently accessed data from RAM and transfers it to the CPU for faster processing.

These methods work well for classical bits, but quantum bits (qubits) present unique challenges when it comes to storing and reading quantum information.

### Retaining Quantum State

In quantum computing, the challenge of **retaining the quantum state** is a major hurdle. Unlike classical bits, which can be easily represented by simple electrical or magnetic properties, qubits depend on delicate quantum phenomena. A few examples of natural qubits include:

- **Spinning of an electron**
- **Spinning of a nucleus**
- **Phase shifting of light waves**

These are naturally occurring quantum systems used to represent qubits. However, to gain more control over qubits, scientists generate **man-made qubits** using specialized circuits, like the **LC circuit** or the **non-linear LC circuit**. These circuits allow for precise control of energy states.

#### Non-linear LC Circuit

A simple LC circuit consists of an inductor and capacitor. When microwaves are applied to this circuit, they increase the energy levels of electrons in discrete steps. Without additional components, these energy levels would be too close together to effectively control and use for quantum computing.

#### Josephson Junction: Key to Quantum Control

To create qubits with controllable energy levels, a **Josephson junction** is introduced. This junction consists of two superconducting materials separated by a thin insulator, allowing for the creation of distinct energy levels for the qubit. The energy transitions are spaced out, so the qubit operates between only two energy states: the "0" and "1" states.

- **Energy State 0**: Low energy state of the electron.
- **Energy State 1**: High energy state of the electron.

These two energy states are the basis of the quantum bit. By using the Josephson junction, we restrict the system to just these two levels, allowing precise control of the quantum state, including the ability to create superposition states.

### Quantum Processor and Readout

In modern quantum computers, multiple qubits are used in parallel. The **Josephson junctions** and **LC circuits** are arranged in a network to form a **quantum chip**. This quantum chip consists of multiple qubits, each controlled and manipulated by microwave pulses to enter desired quantum states.

The quantum state of these qubits can be **read out** by measuring the system. Special circuits and leads are used to detect the quantum state, allowing scientists to extract the information encoded in the qubit. This is a crucial step in quantum computing, as it allows for the output of quantum computations to be read by classical systems.

## Classical vs Quantum Bit Storage
In classical computers, bits are stored using physical properties like:
- **Magnetic fields** (for hard drives)
- **Electric charges** (for RAM)

However, for **quantum computers**, we can't use the same methods because **quantum bits (qubits)** rely on quantum properties like the spin of an electron or the polarization of a photon, which need special conditions to maintain their quantum state.

## Qubit Creation & Control
### Natural Qubits
These are based on quantum properties of particles, such as:
- **Spin of an electron**
- **Phase shift of light**

Examples of natural qubits include using isotopes like **carbon-13** or **silicon-20**.

### Man-made Qubits
To have more control over qubits, we generate them using special circuits, such as the **LC circuit**, which consists of inductors and capacitors. These circuits help manipulate the energy states of electrons in discrete steps.

## Josephson Junction
The **Josephson junction** is a critical component in quantum computing circuits. It consists of:
- Two **superconducting** materials
- Separated by an **insulator**

It creates distinct energy levels that the qubits can transition between. This is necessary for qubits to represent both **0** and **1** states. The Josephson junction restricts energy transitions to just two states, enabling precise control of the qubitâ€™s state.

## Cooling for Superconductivity
Qubits are extremely sensitive to environmental disturbances. To prevent this:
- Quantum circuits need to be cooled to **near absolute zero** (close to 0 Kelvin).
- This ensures that the superconducting properties of the materials remain active and the qubits stay stable.

This extreme cooling minimizes the risk of **decoherence**, ensuring that the qubits remain unaffected by surrounding heat.

## Quantum Readout & Control
Quantum computers use **leads** connected to circuits to both:
1. **Control** qubit states by applying microwaves to flip them between **0** and **1**.
2. **Read** the state of the qubits through these connections.

A **quantum chip** contains multiple such circuits with Josephson junctions. The entire chip is placed in a specialized **cooling tower** to maintain the low temperatures required for quantum computation.

## Quantum Decoherence
**Quantum decoherence** is one of the biggest challenges in quantum computing. It happens when a qubit loses its quantum properties due to interaction with the environment.

### Coherence Time
The **coherence time** of a qubit is the amount of time it stays in a quantum state before it decoheres. This is a critical research area because qubits are very sensitive to external influences. If they absorb too much energy, their quantum state collapses, hindering quantum operations.

## Summary
- **Classical computers** store bits as electric charges or magnetic fields, while **quantum computers** use delicate quantum states to store qubits.
- **Josephson junctions** in LC circuits allow precise control over the energy states of qubits.
- **Cooling** to near absolute zero is essential for qubits to remain stable and maintain their quantum properties.
- **Quantum decoherence** is a significant challenge, as qubits are highly sensitive to external influences.
