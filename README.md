# Quantum-Computing-Basics
A beginner-friendly guide to understanding quantum computing concepts.

## Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is the study of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels, where classical mechanics no longer applies. To learn more about the basics of quantum mechanics, check out the full explanation in [Introduction to Quantum Mechanics](Introduction/introduction-to-quantum-mechanics.md).
